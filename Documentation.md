## Getting Started
To get started on a new Game in Marcel Engine please download the latest empty Build from [here](https://github.com/marceldobehere/Marcel-Engine/tree/main/Empty%20Builds).

Then you can unzip the File and Open it in Visual Studio.

Your Code will go into the Your Code.cs file.

There the engine is set up already.








## The Engine
Here are the main parts of the engine

### Main Engine
This is the main part of the engine.

#### Initialisation
You can initialise the engine in two ways:
```csharp
MainEngine engine = new MainEngine((SIZE_X, SIZE_Y, FONT_SIZE), SHOULD_WINDOW_MAXIMISE);
//OR
MainEngine engine = new MainEngine((SIZE_X, SIZE_Y, FONT_SIZE), SHOULD_WINDOW_MAXIMISE, FONT_NAME);
```

#### Rendering
The engine renders a Frame with the RenderFrame() Method.
It takes a number as an input and tries to draw at that framerate. If you use -1 as the input, it will draw as fast as it can.
```csharp
RenderFrame(double prefferedFps);
```

You can also change the backround colour with the SetNewBackroundColour() Method. Its takes an int between 0 and 15 as input.

```csharp
SetNewBackroundColour(int colour);
```

#### Collision
You can check the collision between two objects by using the CheckObjectCollision() Method. It takes two Objects as input and returns true, if they are colliding.
```csharp
CheckObjectCollision(Object a, Object b);
```

#### Main Scene
The engine has an active scene by default.

You can change it with the ChangeActiveScene() Method. It takes a scene object as input and replaces the active scene with that one.
```csharp
ChangeActiveScene(Scene new_scene)
```

You can add and Remove Objects with the AddObjectToScene/RemoveObjectFromScene Method. They take an Object as an input.
```csharp
AddObjectToScene(Object obj);
RemoveObjectFromScene(Object obj);
```

#### Camera
The engine also has a Camera. (It IS NOT connected to the local scene!!!)

You can move it around with the following Methods:
```csharp
MoveCameraPosition((int x, int y) position);
MoveXCameraPosition(int x);
MoveYCameraPosition(int y);
```
#### Outdated Input
There's still outdated Input with the GetKey() and GetKeyChar() Method


### Objects
This is the Object class. All of the objects in the whole engine and your game will use it.

Each Object has a Player and a Text Object, an Active Position type, a layer its on, a boolean showing if its shown, a Position, an Offset Position.

#### Creating a new Object
you can make a new Object with the standard constructor.
```csharp
Object Test = new Object();
```
You will then need to set its active object type.
```csharp
Test.ActiveObjectType = 1;
// 0 for none
// 1 for Player
// 2 for Text
```
Each object also has an Update Method which updates its Position and other stuff to the screen.
```csharp
Test.Update();
```
#### Movement
You can move an Object with the following Methods:
```csharp
Move((int x, int y) pos);
MoveX(int amount);
MoveY(int amount);
```
#### Cloning
You can clone any Object with the Clone() Command. This will return an exact copy of the first object, but not linked to it.
```csharp
Clone();
```


#### Player Object
The Player SubObject doesnt need any initialisation. Its ActiveObjectTypeNumber is 1.
You can access the Player SubObject like this:
```csharp
Test.Player
```
The Player Object has the following things:
an Active Sprite, an Active Animation Sprite, a Sprite Library, its Parent Object, Its Rotation and scale, a bool saying if the sprite is animated, the current animation sprite library, an animation library, the frame the animation is on and the animation speed.


You can Turn the Player Object by either changing its rotation or by using the TurnTo command.
```csharp
Test.Player.Rotation = 90; // Sets the rotation to 90Â°
Test.Player.TurnTo(Object obj); // Turns to an Object
Test.Player.TurnTo((int x, int y) pos); // Turns to some location
```

You can also change its scale:
```csharp
Test.Player.Scale = 2; // Makes the Object twice the original size.
```

If you change the scale or rotation by changing the variables you will have to update its Sprite:
```csharp
Test.Player.UpdateSprite();
```
And of course you also have to update the Object.

You can change its Animation by changing the Current animation library and changing the IsSpriteAnimated to true.

And you can interact with the other libaries in it and also dont need to initialise them.

You can also just clone the Player Object:
```csharp
Object.Player clone = Test.Player.Clone();
```

#### Text Object
The Text Object is for Displaying Text. Its ActiveObjectTypeNumber is 2.

It has a Parent Object, the actual Text, the Text colour, the charpixeldata (don't worry about that) and a bool saying if the text has a transparent backround.
The Text Object also doesn't need any initialisation.

You can update its text by changing the Text variable:
```csharp
Object.Text.Text = "Hello, World!";
```

You will need to update the Text if you change the text:
```csharp
Object.Text.UpdateText();
```
And of course you also have to update the Object.

You can also clone the Text Object:
```csharp
Object.Text clone = Test.Text.Clone();
```


#### Scene Object
The scene is a sepperate object in its own class. It can be initialised with a name or without a name:
```csharp
Scene testscene = new Scene();
Scene testscene = new Scene(string _name);
```

It has a List of Objects that you can add and remove Objects to/from.
You can switch The active Scenes with this Class.


### Graphics

The main graphics core.

#### Sprite
A Sprite contains a few things: a boolean saying if it has an image, the image data, the source image data, its border, if its centered, its rotation and its scale.

You can initialise a Sprite with nothing or a path with a filename. (they are relative to the exe and you should put sprites into the engine folder or another folder)

```csharp
Graphics.Sprite test = new Sprite();
Graphics.Sprite test = new Sprite(string Filename, bool _centered);
```

You can also set an Image with the SetImage Method:
```csharp
SetImageFromFile(string filename, bool _centered);
```
And if you do any changes to a sprite, you should use the UpdateImage Method to update the image data!
```csharp
UpdateImage();
```

You can also clone a Sprite
```csharp
Graphics.Sprite testclone = test.Clone();
```


#### SpriteLib
This is a Library with Sprites.

You need to initialise it without anything.

```csharp
Graphics.Sprite_Lib lib = new Graphics.Sprite_Lib(); // sets up a new Sprite Library.
lib.Sprites.Add("Test", test); // the Sprites List is actually a Dictionary!
```


### Sound
Sound manager for the engine.

Sounds are pretty simple to use.

You initialise a Sound Object with a Filename:
```csharp
Sound Testsound = new Sound("test.mp3");
```
Supported Filetypes I think: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992

Then you can either Play the sound (or add it to a queue if a sound is playing)
```csharp
Testsound.Play(bool _loop); // you can decide if the sound should loop
```
or stop all playing things:
```csharp
Testsound.Stop();
```
or stop all playing things and use a new file:
```csharp
Testsound.New_File("test2.mp3");
```
And you can also change its Volume:
```csharp
Testsound.Volume = 95; // 95%
```

### Networking
Networking core for the engine.

#### Server
test

#### Client
test


### Screen
Internal stuff ya dont need to care about



### Internals
Internal stuff of the engine.

#### Debug Logger
test

#### Boot
test
