## Getting Started
To get started on a new Game in Marcel Engine please download the latest empty Build from [here](https://github.com/marceldobehere/Marcel-Engine/tree/main/Empty%20Builds).

Then you can unzip the File and Open it in Visual Studio.

Your Code will go into the Your Code.cs file.

There the engine is set up already.








## The Engine
Here are the main parts of the engine

### Main Engine
This is the main part of the engine.

#### Initialisation
You can initialise the engine in two ways:
```csharp
MainEngine engine = new MainEngine((SIZE_X, SIZE_Y, FONT_SIZE), SHOULD_WINDOW_MAXIMISE);
//OR
MainEngine engine = new MainEngine((SIZE_X, SIZE_Y, FONT_SIZE), SHOULD_WINDOW_MAXIMISE, FONT_NAME);
```

#### Rendering
The engine renders a Frame with the RenderFrame() Method.
It takes a number as an input and tries to draw at that framerate. If you use -1 as the input, it will draw as fast as it can.
```csharp
RenderFrame(double prefferedFps);
```

You can also change the backround colour with the SetNewBackroundColour() Method. Its takes an int between 0 and 15 as input.

```csharp
SetNewBackroundColour(int colour);
```

#### Collision
You can check the collision between two objects by using the CheckObjectCollision() Method. It takes two Objects as input and returns true, if they are colliding.
```csharp
CheckObjectCollision(Object a, Object b);
```

#### Main Scene
The engine has an active scene by default.

You can change it with the ChangeActiveScene() Method. It takes a scene object as input and replaces the active scene with that one.
```csharp
ChangeActiveScene(Scene new_scene)
```

You can add and Remove Objects with the AddObjectToScene/RemoveObjectFromScene Method. They take an Object as an input.
```csharp
AddObjectToScene(Object obj);
RemoveObjectFromScene(Object obj);
```

#### Camera
The engine also has a Camera. (It IS NOT connected to the local scene!!!)

You can move it around with the following Methods:
```csharp
MoveCameraPosition((int x, int y) position)
MoveXCameraPosition(int x)
MoveYCameraPosition(int y)
```
#### Outdated Input
There's still outdated Input with the GetKey() and GetKeyChar() Method


### Objects
This is the Object class. All of the objects in the whole engine and your game will use it.

Each Object has a Player and a Text Object, an Active Position type, a layer its on, a boolean showing if its shown, a Position, an Offset Position.

#### Creating a new Object
you can make a new Object with the standard constructor.
```csharp
Object Test = new Object();
```
You will then need to set its active object type.
```csharp
Test.ActiveObjectType = 1;
// 0 for none
// 1 for Player
// 2 for Text
```
Each object also has an Update Method which updates its Position and other stuff to the screen.
```csharp
Test.Update();
```
